## Introduction

Air pollution poses a significant global threat, impacting human health, ecosystems, and economies. Sources such as vehicle emissions, industrial activities, and natural factors contribute to declining air quality worldwide, leading to respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, reduced lifespans, and ecological damage. Effective monitoring and regulation are crucial as urbanization and industrialization escalate, exacerbating air quality issues. In Southeast Asia, where dense populations and rapid industrial growth coincide with recurrent haze from biomass burning, robust air quality surveillance is vital. SEAirSense, a web-based application, addresses this challenge by offering real-time air quality data via an interactive map and APIs. This tool enhances public awareness and aids policymakers in tackling regional air pollution problems proactively.

## Problem Statements and Objectives

### Problem Statements
1. **Lack of Accessible Information**:
   - In Southeast Asia, the public and policymakers lack quick access to current information on air quality, making it difficult to understand the scope of air pollution and its immediate consequences.
2. **Lack of Public Awareness**:
   - Many people are unaware of how air quality influences their daily lives and long-term health.
3. **Need for Technological Assistance in Policy Making**:
   - Policymakers need precise and up-to-date information to construct policies that reduce pollution and enhance air quality.

### Objectives
1. **Provide Real-Time AQI Data**:
   - SEAirSense aims to close the information gap by providing real-time AQI data via a straightforward web platform, allowing users to obtain current air quality statistics for various locations across the region.
2. **Raise Public Awareness**:
   - SEAirSense aims to spread awareness by providing comprehensive knowledge on air pollution and its consequences, enabling users to make informed decisions regarding their health and lifestyle.
3. **Assist Policymakers**:
   - SEAirSense provides broad air quality data and trends to guide policy decisions and assess the efficacy of current solutions.

## Programme Scope

SEAirSense is designed for Southeast Asia's general public, lawmakers, and environmental authorities. The system aims to offer users publicly available and intelligible air quality information to make informed decisions regarding their health and lifestyle. SEAirSense is deployed using GitHub Pages, which hosts the static website. The software uses APIs from the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) for the interactive map and IQAir for comprehensive air quality statistics in specific locations. The website was developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, resulting in a lightweight and responsive design that works on various platforms, including desktops, laptops, and tablets. To use the platform, all users need is an internet-connected device and an updated internet browser, making SEAirSense a network-based solution for obtaining real-time air quality information from anywhere with an internet connection.

## Limitations

1. **Data Coverage**:
   - Due to constraints imposed by API service providers, not all places have AQI information available, resulting in gaps in the data shown on SEAirSense.
2. **Static Website Limitations**:
   - As a static website, SEAirSense possesses limited functions compared to dynamic web apps, meaning advanced features like real-time interaction with users and dynamic content updates are not easily accessible.
