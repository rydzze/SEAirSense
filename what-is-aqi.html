            <h2>What is the Air Quality Index (AQI)?</h2>

            <div id="center-text">
                <p>The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a <strong>standardized scale used to measure and communicate the quality of the air in a specific area at a given time</strong>. It provides a simple way to understand how clean or polluted the air is and the potential health effects associated with different levels of air pollution.</p>
                <p>The AQI is typically <strong>calculated based on concentrations of major air pollutants</strong>, including particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). Each pollutant has its own AQI scale, and the overall AQI value is determined by the highest individual value among these pollutants.</p>
                <p>The AQI scale ranges from 0 to 500, with lower values indicating better air quality and higher values indicating worse air quality. It is <strong>divided into different categories</strong>, such as <strong>Good, Moderate, Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups, Unhealthy, Very Unhealthy, and Hazardous</strong>, each corresponding to a range of AQI values and associated health effects.</p>
                <p>By monitoring the AQI, individuals, communities, and public health officials can make informed decisions to protect public health, such as issuing air quality alerts, implementing pollution control measures, and advising vulnerable populations to take precautions.</p>

                    <h3>Industrial Emissions</h3>
                    <p>Industries <strong>release a variety of pollutants</strong>, including particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, into the air through manufacturing processes and combustion activities.</p>
                    <p>These emissions <strong>contribute significantly to air pollution</strong>, affecting both human health and the environment by causing respiratory problems, environmental degradation, and climate change.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Traffic and Transportation</h3>
                    <p>The <strong>combustion of fossil fuels in vehicles</strong>, such as cars, trucks, and buses, emits pollutants like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds.</p>
                    <p>These emissions are major contributors to <strong>urban air pollution</strong>, leading to smog formation, respiratory diseases, and adverse effects on cardiovascular health. Traffic congestion exacerbates these issues, particularly in densely populated areas with high vehicle density.</p>

                    <h3>Agricultural Practices</h3>
                    <p>Agricultural activities, including livestock farming and the use of fertilizers, contribute to air pollution through the <strong>release of ammonia and methane</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Livestock farming, in particular, generates significant amounts of <strong>ammonia</strong> through animal waste decomposition and urine volatilization, while <strong>methane</strong> is emitted during enteric fermentation in ruminant animals.</p>

                    <h3>Natural Sources</h3>
                    <p>Natural sources such as wildfires, volcanic eruptions, dust storms, and pollen <strong>release pollutants and allergens into the air</strong>, affecting air quality and posing health risks, while also contributing to broader environmental impacts.</p>
                    <p>These events can lead to <strong>short-term spikes in pollution levels and exacerbate respiratory conditions</strong>, highlighting the importance of understanding and mitigating their effects.</p>
